## Overview
Mack Richardson Media is the gateway website to the work and hobbies of Mack Richardson.
## Quick Start

1. [Generate a repo from this template](https://github.com/macktropolis/j211ty/generate)
   which will copy this project into your own new repo.
2. Delete the `public` directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install 11ty and other dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to run both 11ty and sass in watch mode. Use `npm run build` to run a production version, which will also generate social share preview images.
5. Open `src/_data/site.json` and adjust the values to your details.
6. Review the [11ty documentation](https://11ty.dev) to more deeply apply customizations, including adding custom data sources and reviewing what template languages are available.
## Development Scripts

**`npm start`**

> Run 11ty with hot reload at localhost:8080

**`npm run build`**

> Production build includes minified, autoprefixed CSS and social preview image generation

Use this as the "Publish command" if needed by hosting such as Netlify.
