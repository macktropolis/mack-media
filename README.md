# J211ty
> Created by Mack Richardson ([@macktropolis](https://github.com/macktropolis))

## Overview
J211ty [ Jammin' 2 11ty ] is a Jamstack site framework meant to get your site up and running quickly with Eleventy and SASS.
## Quick Start

1. [Generate a repo from this template](https://github.com/macktropolis/j211ty/generate)
   which will copy this project into your own new repo.

1. Once cloned, run `npm install` to install 11ty and other dependencies. Then run `npm start` to run both 11ty and sass in watch
   mode. Use `npm run build` to run a production version, which will also generate social share
   preview images.

1. Open `src/_data/site.json` and adjust the values to your details.

2. Review the [11ty documentation](https://11ty.dev) to more deeply apply customizations, including
   adding custom data sources and reviewing what template languages are available.

### Is Netlify hosting required?

It's not required, but highly recommended. The build process is setup to run using Netlify.

## Development Scripts

**`npm start`**

> Run 11ty with hot reload at localhost:8080

**`npm run build`**

> Production build includes minified, autoprefixed CSS and social preview image generation

Use this as the "Publish command" if needed by hosting such as Netlify.
