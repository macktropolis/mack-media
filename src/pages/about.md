### About Mack

---

#### Humble Beginnings...

Born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_North_Carolina" target="_blank">Burlington, North Carolina <i class="far fa-external-link-square-alt"></i></a> in 1969, I was raised by loving and supportive parents, Mack Sr. and Sylvia. I attended Cummings High School, where by my senior year in 1987 I was the first student in the school's history to take and pass three Advanced Placement Exams *(in English, Biology and American History)*. The college credits won by passing the AP Exams gave me a leg up on my college career at the <a href="https://uncg.edu" target="_blank">University of North Carolina at Greensboro *(UNCG)* <i class="far fa-external-link-square-alt"></i></a> where I graduated with a B.A. degree in Economics with a minor in History.

#### Secret Origin...

However, my *(not so)* secret passion was computers. My love of computers began in 1985 when my parents gave me the gift which every budding nerd dreamed about...a Macintosh 512K!

I put my new *"Fat Mac"* to work organizing my other passion: **comic books**. My Mac came with AppleWorks which included a rudimentary database builder which I used to build an inventory system for my ever growing collection.

Little did I know at the time, AppleWorks' database engine was a stripped down version of the FileMaker database which would be the catalyst for my transition from computer hobbyist to IT professional.

After graduating from UNCG in 1991, I opened my own comic book store: **Rocket Comics**. At Rocket Comics I used FileMaker Pro to develop an inventory management and Point-of-Sale system to run store operations.

#### With Great Power...

By 1998 I worked for Volvo Action Service *(VAS)*, a 24-hour support center for Volvo product owners. It was at VAS that I was reunited with FileMaker. A critical, but aging, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_i" target="_blank">AS/400 <i class="far fa-external-link-square-alt"></i></a> system was being decommissioned by Volvo but VAS did not have an immediate replacement. The task fell to me to develop a new tool to keep the operation running smoothly. Within 30 days, I developed and deployed the Emergency Management System *(EMS)* with all the features of the system it was replacingâ€¦and then some! EMS continued to be expanded and developed as VAS' requirements grew.

#### World's Collide...

While I was focusing on database design and development, the internet was changing the world...and would change my life. Like my work with databases, my web development career started with a problem in need of a solution. The website for VAS had grown laughably out of date and my boss asked if I could replace it with a new design? I said, **"Sure"** ... and dove head first into the HTML pool. That site redesign was the beginning of a love affair with HTML, and eventually CSS and jQuery, that is still going strong.

#### Meanwhile, In His Secret Lair...

These days, I run a small consultancy, **[Qube](https://qube.consulting)**, developing web and FileMaker Platform apps for clients both big and small. When not working, I'm enjoying the small town life in rural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkertown,_North_Carolina" target="_blank">Walkertown, North Carolina <i class="far fa-external-link-square-alt"></i></a> with my beautiful wife, *Lara*, and my dog, *Stubby*.
